#  AI vs Human Image Detector
This project is a web-based application that can detect whether an uploaded image was **generated by AI** or **captured by a human**. It uses a trained deep learning model and is built using **FastAPI**.

##@ 🚀 Live Demo

👉 **Try it here:** [https://detect-ai-vs-human-image.onrender.com] (https://detect-ai-vs-human-image.onrender.com)

> No installation required — just upload an image and get instant results.

## 📸 How It Works

- Users upload an image (JPG or PNG).
- The backend uses a pre-trained **Keras deep learning model** to classify the image.
- The result is shown as either:
  - ✅ **Human**
  - 🤖 **AI-generated**
  - 
## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (via Jinja2 templates)
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Model:** TensorFlow / Keras
- **Deployment:** Render (Dockerized)
- **Others:** NumPy, Pillow, scikit-learn, OpenCV

## 📁 Project Structure
## 📌 Notes
- The model was trained on a custom dataset (details omitted for brevity).
- Optimizer state may show warnings when loading the `.keras` file; this is expected and safe to ignore.
- GPU is not required — works on CPU.
